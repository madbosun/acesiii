C We need to decide whether we choose QST or LST climbing or eigenvector
C following.
C The recommendation in Schlegel et al. is "estimated displacement
C along the tangent vector is greater than 0.05 au. to use climbing.
C Otherwise it is a standard eigenvector following. With regards to
C eigenvector following Schlegel recommend that when the overlap
C between LST or QST tangent with the Hessian eigenvectors is greater
C than 0.08 au, then switch the eigenvectors to follow the one with
C the maximum overlap with the tangent; otherwise, the eigenvector
C with the smallest eigenvalue is followed.
C
C Also, Schlegel recommend to cap the QST or LST climbing steps to 4.
C Since I do not know an empirical formula to estimate the displacement,
C I am going to use simple Newton-Raphson to estimate the stepsize to
C decide whether we are going to climb. That is what's decided in
C QSTLST_OR_EVEC. There is one aspect that is not clear from the papers:
C the direction of the climb. Since the tangent is not an eigenvector
C of the Hessian, I presume when he says that "the tangent to the
C path is used to choose the best eigenvectors for ascent..." what he
C meant is that the eigenvector that has maximum overlap with the tangent.

C The following logic (bit cleaned up) is what we have been using. It
C is retained just in case the user did not want to do any QST or LST
C eigenvector following. The logic pertains to identifying the eigenvector
C that corresponds to the lowest (IVEC=1, the default), next to the lowest
C (IVEC=2), and so on (user's choice) during the first cycle and then for
C the subsequent steps use the eigenvector that has the largest overlap with
C the previous vector. I think we should add the capability to follow the
C lowest, next to lowest, and so on regardless of what happens in the previous
C cycle. It might just even work better!!!
